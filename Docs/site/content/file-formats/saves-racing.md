# F1GP Saved Games (during races)

There are different kinds of saved games. The documentation here refers to
games that have been saved _during_ during a qualifying or race session.

For information about games that are saved _between_ season races, see
the [F1GP Saved Games (between races)](/argdocs/file-formats/saves) page.
