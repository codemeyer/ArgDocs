# Camera Definitions (Track File Format)

By default, the game places a camera at the left side of every 16 track length units. The command definitions
here can then move them further back, swap them to the right side, or just remove them.

Variable length from 14 bytes (Phoenix) to 60 (Spa-Francorchamps)

Terminated by 0xFF FF
